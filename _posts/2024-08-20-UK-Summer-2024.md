After watching [Pride and Prejudice](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=820aaa15062e62d5&sxsrf=ADLYWIKAr8qUYdmz_vt02GTAW-ImdrV6GA:1724254070417&q=Pride+and+Prejudice+2005&si=ACC90nw_jPf0U9OHQLTsJBfNBfuzWP04Qb7uUj5bJ7NOdlcOVGwN1SFpiK6EN2dd5ZA3PoKw-QNMWragZZQUqvQdD8GZ-S3sfTzpQBRSwjIeQ_V23Oy-CMmdBX8P3kZ6T2wOo5ePEBk3YZsxz57dZKCASv9oMzK103hv-RW5k50s3lVoCd19YZOEztQo2aV2_UbkY3UJexp4PLYWfIm79yBJlonhbqHDq4QT-RRvGEVuQhN6AWj1u2WO7vUkA2rGM2P4Eb4nPVmkxcyE6w8PURDtf2T5fkDZhA%3D%3D&sa=X&sqi=2&ved=2ahUKEwjpp_r6soaIAxWR4MkDHfv6KWkQ3LoBegQIBBAB&biw=1398&bih=1139&dpr=1){:target="_blank"}, I wanted to visit [Chatsworth](https://www.chatsworth.org/){:target="_blank"} and check out the gorgeous green scenary. That's what made me plan this trip. I wanted to exlore the English countryside. Also, I needed to escape from the Texan summer, and am alway up for trying out some michelin listed restaurants.

### Itinerary

#### Day 1 - 2: Traveling From Austin, TX To Bakewell, UK

Pretty much spend all day plus some to get to the first destination, Bakewell, UK near [Chatsworth](https://www.chatsworth.org/){:target="_blank"}

- **Flight** from Austin, TX, stop over at Dallas, TX, then to London, UK (overnight between Dallas and London) 
- **Train** using [Piccadilly line](https://tfl.gov.uk/tube/route/piccadilly/){:target="_blank"} from Heathrow Terminal 5 to King's Cross St (London), then a [EMR train](https://www.eastmidlandsrailway.co.uk/){:target="_blank"}  from Pancras International(London) to Chesterfield
- Took a Uber from Chesterfield station to my **hotel**, [Fischer's At Baslow Hall](#fischers-baslow-hotel)

<h5 id="fischers-baslow-hotel">Hotel: Fischer's At Baslow Hall</h5>

I stayed 3 nights at Fischer's Baslow Hall, and loved it! It's a beautiful boutique hotel with well kept garden and friendiest staff. The room was charming and rather large for a British hotel room, with modernized bathroom with a soaking tub and separate shower. I love the fact that the interior is "country cottage style" but with a clean & modern tone. The room also had a small sitting area with bench and a table right outside, in a walled garden area, giving a sense of privacy even though the garden area is a shared space among several guest rooms.

Their restaurant is not stared but is listed in [Michelin guide](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/derbyshire/baslow/restaurant/fischer-s-at-baslow-hall){:target="_blank"}. I enjoyed their daily breakfast and dinner (breakfast was complimentary; dinner is additional).

#### Day 3 - 4: Exploring Peak District Area

Spent 2 full days in Peak distrect, visiting castles/estates in the area, Chatsworth House and Haddon Hall. My method of getting around was "walking". I didn't get an international driver license for the trip, so renting a car was out of option. Even if I did, I'm not sure if I can safely drive in UK. Looking at their roads, I'm not confident which lane I should be in. Besides, the whole point of this trip was to indulge in the country scenaries on foot just as I saw it in the movie. 

<h5 id="chatsworth">Estate: Chatsworth House</h5>

This is the estate that was used as Pemberley, the home of Mr Darcy in the 2005 film adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. The very picturesque scene in the movie was what made me plan this trip. Gorgeous inside and out. Architecture, art collections, gardens, and trees, gigantic trees everwhere in the property...stunning everywhere you look.
