That's what made me plan this trip. I wanted to exlore the English countryside. Also, I needed to escape from the Texan summer, and am alway up for trying out some michelin listed restaurants.

### Itinerary

Pretty much spend all day plus some to get to the first destination, Baslow, UK near [Chatsworth](https://www.chatsworth.org/){:target="_blank"}

<h5 id="fischers-baslow-hotel">Hotel: Fischer's At Baslow Hall</h5>

I stayed 3 nights at Fischer's Baslow Hall, and loved it! It's a beautiful boutique hotel with well kept garden and friendiest staff. The room was charming and rather large for a British hotel room, with modernized bathroom with a soaking tub and separate shower. I love the fact that the interior is "country cottage style" but with a clean & modern tone. The room also had a small sitting area with bench and a table right outside, in a walled garden area, giving a sense of privacy even though the garden area is a shared space among several guest rooms.

Their restaurant is not stared but is listed in [Michelin guide](https://guide.michelin.com/us/en/derbyshire/baslow/restaurant/fischer-s-at-baslow-hall){:target="_blank"}. I enjoyed their daily breakfast and dinner (breakfast was complimentary; dinner is additional).
