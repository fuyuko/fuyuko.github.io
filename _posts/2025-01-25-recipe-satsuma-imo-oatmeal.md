This oatmeal may be my MOST favoriate oatmeal I've ever made so far. It's not overly sweet, satisfying, and not too high on calories...comes out about 300 kcals for 1 serving. And I can make it in about 20 minutes.

### Ingredients

- 100g Satsuma Imo (Japanese Sweet Potato)
- 40g Rolled Oats
- 10g Light Brown Sugar (or a sweetener of your choice)
- 1 cup Unsweetened Almond Milk (or a milk of your choice)

### Steps

1. Slice the potato using a mandoline slicer. (You can cut the potato with a cooking knife instead. I use the slicer so that the potato is super thin which means I can cook it MUCH faster)
1. Rinse the potato in cold water several times until water is somewhat clear. (This process is to get rid of excess starch and lye, and to prevent discoloring of the potato.)
1. Boil the potato in a saucepan with water for about 10 minutes until soft.
1. Drain the water
1. Add the sweetener, milk, oatmeal to the boiled & drained potatoe in the saucepan and cook in low-medium heat for about 5 minutes until the rolled oat is cooked and the oatmeal is thickened.
